Bhaiya Bot ü§ñ - Your Personal AI Voice Tutor
Live Demo: bhaiyabot.netlify.app

Bhaiya Bot is an intelligent, conversational AI voice tutor designed to provide personalized academic help to students of all levels, from nursery school to those preparing for competitive exams like JEE and NEET.

üåü About The Project
The inspiration for Bhaiya Bot came from watching my own brother prepare for his NEET exams. He often had specific questions but no one was available at that moment to provide a clear, understandable explanation. I realized that millions of students face this same challenge. They don't just need an answer; they need an explanation tailored to their level of understanding.

Bhaiya Bot was built to be that "always-on" study companion‚Äîa knowledgeable older brother (a "Bhaiya") who can explain anything, anytime, in a way that truly makes sense.

Key Features
üé§ Voice & Text Input: Ask questions naturally by speaking or typing.

üß† Dynamic Expertise Levels: The bot adapts its teaching style and answer complexity based on the user's selected academic level (from Nursery to JEE/NEET).

üîä Text-to-Speech Output: Hear the answers spoken aloud for a truly conversational learning experience.

üõë Stop Speaking Functionality: Full control to stop the bot's voice output at any time.

‚ú® Modern & Professional UI: A sleek, responsive, and visually appealing interface built with a dark theme and "glassmorphism" effects.

üöÄ Live on the Web: Fully deployed and accessible to anyone with a web browser.
